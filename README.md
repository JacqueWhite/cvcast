# Show-and-Tell
This is a web application that showcases developer projects.

TODO stuff:
- Editing fields after they've been populated by react seems impossible without rendering a completely new element on click. See here: https://themeteorchef.com/tutorials/click-to-edit-fields-in-react
- Still need to query the DB for just the projects owned by the current user.

Issues:
-proxy setting in the client package.jason only needs to be there for dev work. We need to get heroku to use npm run build instead of npm start.
